# parallel-programming-experiments

Hey there!

A collection of parallelized algorithms using OpenMP and MPI, developed as part of a university course. The original scripts were provided, and my task was to parallelize them. This repository contains two versions of the same algorithm: one parallelized with OpenMP, and the other with MPI (which didnâ€™t bring significant efficiency improvements). A great example of how different parallelization techniques can affect performance.
